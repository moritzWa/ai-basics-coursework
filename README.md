## Projects
My projects focus on planning because its techniques will be applied in my current CODE project study journey. 

### Planning
- Maze
- TicTacToe


### Optimization
- Crossword

This repository includes an AI to create a crossword puzzle. It's technically speaking, not an optimization but a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). It would be one if there were a continuous rating of a produced crossword puzzle. However, with this exercise, the outcome was binary. 

### Reasoning
- Minesweeper

### Neural Networks
- Traffic
